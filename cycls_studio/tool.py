STUDIO_GUIDANCE = """## Studio (3D)
Build scenes with the `studio` tool; the user watches them appear in the Studio app and can move things by hand.
- Open the Studio once per conversation (`open`) when you start building, so the user can watch.
- Make a whole scene in ONE `edit`: start from a `preset` (studio lighting + backdrop + framed camera) after adding the objects, since the preset frames what exists.
- Z is up, metres, degrees. Stand things on the ground with `on_floor: true`; aim cameras and lights with `look_at`, and re-frame with `frame` — don't compute Euler angles by hand.
- "this"/"that"/"it" usually means what the user selected: use id "selected". `inspect` shows the selection.
- Check your work with `snapshot` (5 s) before a final `render` (25-60 s). Look at the preview: framing, overlaps, floating objects, materials.
- An image the user gives you (a logo, a label, a photo): `add {image: {path}}` for a flat sign or label in front of a surface, or a material's `base_color_texture: {path}` to wrap it round an object. Tile patterns with `texture_scale`.
- Motion: `turntable` for a product spin; `keyframe` for moves (key the start, then later frames). `snapshot {frame}` checks a pose; `render {animation: true}` makes the video — say roughly how long it will take, and don't wait for it.
- Use `script` only for what ops can't express; never edit apps/studio/data/ files directly.
- After a render, describe what you made in a sentence and offer one concrete variation."""
