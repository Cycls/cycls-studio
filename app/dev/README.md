# Studio dev harness

Drive the built Studio app outside the chat — in a browser, or headless Chrome from a
script — with the real host shim and bridge in front of it and the real engine route
behind it. Used to check every change that needs WebGL (the viewport can't run in vitest)
and to compare Material Preview against a Cycles render of the same scene.

```bash
cd app && npm run build                         # the bundle the harness serves
uv run python dev/server.py --env <agent>/.providers.env    # :8094, workspace in dev/ws (seeded)
node dev/driver.mjs                             # headless Chrome on the host page, control on :9400
dev/drive.sh - < dev/checks/drag.js             # select, drag the gizmo, check the autosave
dev/drive.sh - < dev/checks/edit.js             # Edit mode: Tab, pick the top face, inset, extrude
dev/drive.sh - < dev/checks/tools.js            # loop cut, knife, proportional, snapping, Blender round trip
uv run --with pillow python dev/compare.py dev/shots/probe.png <cycles.png> dev/shots/cmp.png
```

- `server.py` runs in this repo's venv (`uv run`). It bundles the host page from an SDK
  checkout's client (`CYCLS_SDK`, default `../cycls-sdk`, with `client/node_modules`). For engine
  calls it needs `CYCLS_API_KEY` + `CYCLS_STUDIO_ENGINE` in the env files it loads. Restart it
  after changing `route.py` — it imports the route once.
- `?late=2000` on the host URL mounts the frame at zero size and grows it after 2 s, as
  the chat's canvas does while it slides open.
- `window.__studio` is the app controller inside the frame (`evalApp`); `window.__log`
  and `window.__push(command)` (an agent `app_command`) live in the host page (`evalHost`).
